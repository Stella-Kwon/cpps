// C++ will generate a default copy assignment operator for you. The default operator:

// Performs a member-wise copy, copying each member variable from the source object to the target object.
// Does not handle special cases like dynamic memory or resource management.


// Member functions are shared among all objects and are stored once in memory (text/code segment).
// Static members are shared among all objects and are stored in a single memory location (data segment).
// The this pointer allows member functions to know which object they are working with. but not with static members as they do not requires object
