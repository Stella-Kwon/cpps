// Initialization (e.g., Fixed a = b;) uses the copy constructor.
// Assignment (e.g., a = b;) uses the copy assignment operator.

// if there is no defined copy assignemnet operator (What If You Donâ€™t Overload operator=?)
// If you don't explicitly define your own operator= in your Fixed class,
// C++ will generate a default copy assignment operator for you. The default operator:

// Performs a member-wise copy, copying each member variable from the source object to the target object.
// Does not handle special cases like dynamic memory or resource management.


// Member functions are shared among all objects and are stored once in memory (text/code segment).
// Static members are shared among all objects and are stored in a single memory location (data segment).
// The this pointer allows member functions to know which object they are working with. but not with static members as they do not requires object

    // The 'this' pointer refers to the current object being created (new object).
    // 'oldFixed' is the source object from which the data will be copied.
    // however the oldFixed should not copied again as it is calling another copy constructor 
    // which will lead stack overflow or infinite loop. 
    // This would lead to infinite recursion because the copy constructor would call itself repeatedly to create oldFixed
    // for the efficient memory management we should give the parameter(oldFixed)as a reference.

    // Why const Fixed& is Used:
    // Const Reference: The const Fixed& ensures that the assignment operator can accept both lvalues (named objects) and rvalues (temporary objects) without any issues.

    // Lvalues: Can be any object that exists and is named (e.g., Fixed a = b;).
    // Rvalues: Are temporary objects or expressions that generate temporary objects (e.g., Fixed a = Fixed(3.14f);).
    
    // Temporary Handling: The const keyword is used C++ extends the lifetime of that temporary object for the duration of the operator's execution.
    // in which allows to receive temporary object accessible until the end of the function's scope.
    
    // Efficiency: Passing by reference (const Fixed&) is more efficient than 
    //passing by value because it avoids making a copy of the object being passed.

    // this is also effecting for anycases like operator overload;
    *this = oldFixed;
